# Cartoon Me! 

## Introduction
I wanted to try my hand at building some sort of image manipulation app. Cartoon Me! takes an image, and transforms it into a cartoon version using OpenCV. The effect is similair to a Photoshop filter. This was a learning exercise which allowed me to get exposure to OpenCV, easygui and Matplotlib for the first time.

## Features:
* User selects an image and the app finds it edges and makes them black.
* Smoothes out colours.
* Converts image to grayscale.
* Displays all images in a grid using Matplotlib.
* Allows the user to save the "cartooned" image.

## Main technologies:
* Python 3.9.2
* OpenCV
* Matplotlib
